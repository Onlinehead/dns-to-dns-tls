# What is the goal?
That is a small service to run as a sidecar to secure DNS requests of your service.

# Security concerns
Certificate validation is enabled, so it more or less secure. Based on a popular 'miekg/dns' library.

# Improvements
You are welcome to add any improvements like extended logging, DNS-over-HTTPS support, caching, etc.
